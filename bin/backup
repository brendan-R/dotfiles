# This requires the environment variables $B2_ACCOUNT_ID, $B2_APP_KEY,
# $B2_MACHINE_BUCKET, $DIR_TO_BACKUP, and $BACKUP_KEY_ID to be set and exported,
# by tradition in your ~/.bash.local
#
# Also, duplicity has an option which prevents resuming backups with a "key not
# on the machine" type setup. You've fixed this locally by commenting out the
# line validate_encryption_settings(globals.restart.last_backup, mf) in
# /usr/bin/duplicity which is extremely hacky. An ideal solution would this
# being controllable via CLI flags, and submitted as a patch. You should do
# that.
#
# Borked backups can often be fixed with rm -rf $HOME/.cache/duplicity/* , which
# stores the local metadata/manifest for what should be where
